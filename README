This is a space to collect utilities to work with hOCR as specified in
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQnIQtvdAC_8n92-LhwPcjtAUFwBlzE8EWnKAxlgVf0/preview?pli=1#

Right now there is a simple transformation to ALTO which guesses
<Illustration>s and <GraphicalElement>s

When running from the command line saxon, please configure a system
catalog.xml so that it does not request the dtd for every
transformation from the w3c site. When running from one of the IDEs,
this should generally already been catered for.

The transformation hOCR2ALTO lives in xsl/hOCR2ALTO.xsl

a sample call would be:

$ saxon -s:<XMLFILE> xsl/hOCR2ALTO.xsl
